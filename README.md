# DiamondArtCreator
 Create your own Diamond Painting templates

The DiamondArtCreator is based on the program code of "Stitch Art Easy" by Mykola Kovalchuk (https://github.com/MykolaKovalchuk/SAE5) 
and was expanded and adapted by me to create templates specifically for diamond painting.

Our specially developed program offers you the possibility to create a tailor-made template in just a few steps.

Simply load your photo into the program and select the type of stones, the number of colors and the size of the template. 
DAC shows you all the necessary information clearly, from the template to the simple order list.

Diamond Art Creator was developed by experienced pixlers who know exactly what requirements must be met to turn 
your photos and images into stunning diamond paintings. 
We have implemented their visions and developed DAC with an intuitive user interface and comprehensive functionality.

The user interface is available in 3 languages: German, English and French.
